        Research statement
In the past few years, I have been studying various areas of cognitive science, including working memory, visual perception, and object recognition. Below, I describe briefly each of the projects that I was/am in charge of:
Project on working memory
In this project, I aimed to quantitatively measure the magnitude of distractor-induced interference as a function of probe-distractor similarity and probe the possible sources of interference with mathematical modeling. Specifically, I created a parametric version of the classic 2-back task in which each stimulus in a sequence took values on a continuous feature (color and orientation) space. We proposed three hypotheses regarding the possible sources of the distractor-induced interference: the interference results from the observer (1) mixing the target and distractor features at the encoding stage; or (2) mixing the decision variables based on the target and distractor separately; or (3) confusing the identities of the target and distractor, thus basing their decision either on the target or distractor with a variable probability on a single trial. An optimal observer model along with three Bayesian-augmented models corresponding to each of the three hypotheses were proposed to examine the sources of the interference. Experimentally, we found that interference was larger when the feature distance between the probe and the distractor was smaller, and interference even occurred when the 1-back distractor was completely irrelevant to the task. The modeling results suggest that interference in the 2-back task results either from the pooling of decision variables based the target and distractor separately, or from the substitution of the distractor for the target. Our study opens the door to parametrically examining the sources of interference in similar cognitive tasks (this work is supervised by Prof. Wei Ji Ma at NYU, and we are currently working intensively on the paper).
Projects on visual perception
  1. Heading perception. In this project, I examined the effect of a moving object on heading perception from optic flow using a combination of psychophysics and neural network modeling methods. Experimentally, I found that a moving object did not need to occlude the Focus of Expansion (FoE) in order to induce heading bias, and the direction of heading bias was determined by both the motion direction and physical position of the moving object. By fitting the neural network model to the data, we found that the visual system does not treat independent object motion separately for heading estimate (this work was supervised by Prof. Li Li at HKU and has been published).
2. Heading perception. In this project, I tested whether the visual system can optimally combine the central and peripheral cues in heading perception. By fitting the optimal cue combination model to the psychophysical data, I found that instead of optimally integrating information from the central and peripheral flow fields, the visual system disproportionally relied more on the central flow field to estimate headings. The observer thus behaves in a non-optimal way (this work is supervised by Prof. Li Li at HKU and the paper is in prep).
3. Visual search. In this project, I aim to model the effects of set size and target- distractor similarity on visual search performance. Experimentally, we varied the target- distractor similarity on a continuous feature (e.g., color) space and the set size across trials. We found that the accuracy decreased and reaction times (RTs) increased as the target-distractor similarity decreased and set size increased. However, the effects of target-distractor similarity and set size on RT were minimal for some subjects. My goal is thus to simulate the effects of target-distractor similarity and set size on visual research performance, and reveal the underlying strategies the subjects used (this work is supervised by Prof. Hang Zhang at PKU, in progress).
4. Ensemble perception. In this project, my goal is to examine and model the influences of cross-item variability and single-item saliency on ensemble perception of orientation. Experimentally, I divided all items (oriented Gabor patches) in a display equally into a high-contrast group and a low-contrast group, and varied the variance across items within
  each group. On modeling front, I test three pooling/averaging rules: the observer (1) averages features of all displayed items and treat each indistinctly; (2) averages only a subset of items with high salient features (i.e., average only high-contrast items); (3) averages each of the items with different weights determined by both the across-item variability and single-item saliency. I have proposed three models to verify each of the three pooling rules (working on this project on my own, in progress).
Projects on object recognition
In this project, I aimed to test the effect of sensorimotor information on object recognition process. Specifically, I disentangled functional action (i.e., actions regarding how to use an object) and structural action (i.e., actions regarding how to grasp an object), and found that functional action representation plays a dominant role in the recognition of manipulable objects. Our findings suggest that action knowledge concerning how to use rather than grasp an object is an intrinsic component of objectsâ€™ conceptual representation (this work was supervised by Prof. Fu and Prof. Liu at CAS and has been published). I also created a new set of Chinese image stimuli that were normalized on 12 psycholinguistic variables, which provides a useful tool for studying object recognition, language, and memory processes (this work is currently under review).
