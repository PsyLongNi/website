      In this project, I aimed to quantitatively measure the magnitude of distractor-induced interference as a function of probe-distractor similarity and probe the possible sources of interference with mathematical modeling.<br>
      Specifically, I created a parametric version of the classic 2-back task in which each stimulus in a sequence took values on a continuous feature (color and orientation) space. We proposed three hypotheses regarding the possible sources of the distractor-induced interference: the interference results from the observer (1) mixing the target and distractor features at the encoding stage; <br> or (2) mixing the decision variables based on the target and distractor separately; or (3) confusing the identities of the target and distractor, thus basing their decision either on the target or distractor with a variable probability on a single trial. An optimal observer model along with three Bayesian-augmented models corresponding to each of the three hypotheses were proposed to examine the sources of the interference. Experimentally, we found that interference was larger when the feature distance between the probe and the distractor was smaller, and interference even occurred when the 1-back distractor was completely irrelevant to the task. The modeling results suggest that interference in the 2-back task results either from the pooling of decision variables based the target and distractor separately, or from the substitution of the distractor for the target. Our study opens the door to parametrically examining the sources of interference in similar cognitive tasks
